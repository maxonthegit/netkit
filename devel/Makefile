# Variable: TARGET_ARCH
# Must be either "x86_64" or "i386", depending on the target architecture Netkit
# is to be built for. Example:
# TARGET_ARCH?=x86_64
TARGET_ARCH?=$(shell arch)

# Variable: TOOLS_BUILD_DIR
# Specifies the name of the directory where work files for building
# command line tools will be kept. It is usually a relative path, but absolute
# paths should work as well. Example:
# TOOLS_BUILD_DIR:=bintools-build
TOOLS_BUILD_DIR:=bintools-build-$(TARGET_ARCH)
