=== General ===

- "pack" target in the Makefile
- License statements in all files
- Allow simultaneously running labs with virtual machine having common names (?)
- Accelerate lab shutdown (and, possibly, startup)
- systemd-specific kernel command line parameters (see the systemd man page):
  systemd.show_status=0

=== Kernel ===

- MPLS support (by i-maravic)? => the project is stuck at kernel release 3.9-rc3, and applying an extracted patch to kernel 4.0 already
  results in some failures (already existing files that the patch would create anew with different contents)
- Test functionality of Netkit-specific patches

=== Filesystem ===

- Netkit-specific scripts miss LSB tags and overrides
- Check that shared and machine-specific files are correctly copied inside virtual machines (on first boot only)
- Is mirroring of file permissions from the user's to the group's and other's still required? (in netkit-phase1)
- Set default standard output and error of systemd to journal+console for Netkit scripts (WARNING: some settings in 10-systemd-settings already exist)
- Links quagga <-> zebra (?)
- Link /etc/init.d/bind -> /etc/init.d/bind9 (creating a link is apparently not enough)
- apt/sources.list
- Move quagga sample configurations from /usr/share/doc/quagga/examples to /etc/quagga (beware of file permissions)
- Add Netkit-specific scripts
