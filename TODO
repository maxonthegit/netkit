=== General ===

- Variables passed to the Makefiles do not make it through to the uml-init-stub

- "pack" target in the Makefile
- Document new targets (bintools, etc.)
- License statements in all files
- Allow simultaneously running labs with virtual machine having common names (?)
- Accelerate lab shutdown (and, possibly, startup)
- systemd-specific kernel command line parameters (see the systemd man page):
  systemd.show_status=0
- Document the fact that hostnames with underscores cannot be used (the hostname
  invocation fails)

=== Kernel ===

- MPLS support (by i-maravic)? => the project is stuck at kernel release 3.9-rc3, and applying an extracted patch to kernel 4.0 already
  results in some failures (already existing files that the patch would create anew with different contents)
- Test functionality of Netkit-specific patches

=== Filesystem ===

- Test lab-related scripts (including the banner)

- pgset (packet generator) => found at http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/networking/pktgen.txt?v=2.4.37#L49
- Additional software pieces candidate for installation:
  Lagopus
  FlowVisor
  (sFlow)

- Update list of installed packages with software pieces compiled from source code
