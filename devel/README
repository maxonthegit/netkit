This README file briefly describes the procedure to be applied in order to
(re)build User Mode Linux kernel and filesystem images that can be used with
Netkit.

As a side content, this file also describes how to (re)build the binary tools
that are part of the Netkit user interface.

 WHOM THIS README IS MEANT FOR
______________________________________________________________________________

Standard users should never need to build a kernel or filesystem, because the
kernel and filesystem that are supplied in the downloadable Netkit package are
all that is needed to access the full feature set of Netkit.
This procedure is meant for developers and advanced users who want to introduce
new functionalities or who just want to upgrade the kernel or filesystem to a
more recent release.

Please note that even installing software pieces inside the filesystem image
does not require a complete rebuild. Instead, you can just alter the existing
filesystem image by following the instructions documented in the main Netkit
README file or in the on-line FAQs (http://wiki.netkit.org/index.php/FAQ).

 DISCLAIMER
______________________________________________________________________________

The build steps, scripts, and Makefiles documented in this README are meant to
be used by expert users. They have been designed to be fully automated and to
operate in a safe way for your system, but they have been tested on a very
limited range of platforms and there is no guarantee that they will not cause
harm to your Linux setup. This is especially true because some build steps must
be executed with root privileges.

 HOW TO (RE)BUILD A USER MODE LINUX KERNEL FOR USE WITH NETKIT
______________________________________________________________________________

 * Prerequisites
   - A host machine with a reasonably recent Debian Linux distribution (or
     derived thereof). Debian-specific tools such as dpkg-deb are explicitly
     required.
   - An Internet connection.
   - With respect to a base system installation (we take Ubuntu 15.04 as a
     reference), the following additional packages must be installed:


 * Procedure

In order to build a new kernel you just need to issue the following commands:

   $ cd netkit_dir/devel
   $ make kernel

The Makefile will automatically carry out the following steps:

 1) Download the source package for a vanilla Linux kernel. A default URL is
    used for this step, but it can be changed by setting the KERNEL_SOURCE_URL
    Makefile variable.
 2) Unpack the kernel source package.
 3) Apply Netkit-specific patches to the kernel sources.
 4) Configure the kernel using a pre-established configuration file.
 5) Download a few additional Debian packages, which will not be installed on
    your system but rather just be unpacked to access required header files and
    libraries.
 6) Compile the kernel.
 7) Copy the resulting kernel binary file to netkit_dir/kernel.
 8) Copy the associated kernel modules into an appropriate subdirectory of
    netkit_dir/kernel.

By default, this procedure will build a kernel for the same architecture (32- or
64-bit) as the one of the host machine. It is also possible to cross compile a
kernel for a different target architecture by appropriately setting the
TARGET_ARCH Makefile variable. Only values 'i386' and 'x86_64' are supported at
this time. Convenient Makefile targets can be used as an alternative to setting
TARGET_ARCH:

   $ make kernel32
   $ make kernel64

 HOW TO (RE)BUILD A FILESYSTEM IMAGE FOR USE WITH NETKIT
______________________________________________________________________________

 * Prerequisites
   - A host machine with a reasonably recent Debian Linux distribution (or
     derived thereof). Debian-specific tools such as dpkg-deb are explicitly
     required.
   - Root access on the machine. In addition, the user account that is being
     used to perform the build must belong to the 'disk' group (more generally,
     it must have read/write access to loopback devices /dev/loop*).
   - An Internet connection.
   - With respect to a base system installation (we take Ubuntu 15.04 as a
     reference), the following additional packages must be installed:

   - A Netkit kernel (and its modules) must be available inside
     netkit_dir/kernel/, either as a result of a previous build or as part of
     the downloaded Netkit package.

 * Procedure

Warning: a complete filesystem build may take a (very) long time, even on a
reasonably fast machine. For reference, it takes slightly less than one hour and
half to finish the build for a single target architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) on
a quad-core workstation with a 7200rpm hard drive.

The filesystem build process consists of 3 steps that must be carried out
separately:

   $ cd netkit_dir/devel
   $ make filesystem
   $ sudo make filesystem
   $ make filesystem STAGE=2

The reason for this is that at least some operations require root privileges to
be performed: this motivates the usage of 'sudo' in the second invocation of
'make filesystem'. At the end of the first step, a suitable message will inform
the user that the Makefile must be reinvoked with root privileges on the same
target ('filesystem'). For security reasons, root privileges are dropped as soon
as they are no longer needed: another message at the end of the second step
informs the user that the Makefile can be reinvoked without root privileges (and
with the 'STAGE=2' statement to correctly execute the last part of the build).
