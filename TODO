=== General ===

- "pack" target in the Makefile
- License statements in all files
- Allow simultaneously running labs with virtual machine having common names (?)
- Accelerate lab shutdown (and, possibly, startup)
- systemd-specific kernel command line parameters (see the systemd man page):
  systemd.show_status=0

=== Kernel ===

- MPLS support (by i-maravic)? => the project is stuck at kernel release 3.9-rc3, and applying an extracted patch to kernel 4.0 already
  results in some failures (already existing files that the patch would create anew with different contents)
- Test functionality of Netkit-specific patches

- modpost and other scripts/utilities might be compiled for the wrong architecture (becomes evident when building openvswitch)

=== Filesystem ===

- Test lab-related scripts (including the banner)

- pgset (packet generator) => found at http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/networking/pktgen.txt?v=2.4.37#L49
- Additional software pieces candidate for installation:
  Lagopus
  POX
  FlowVisor
  (sFlow)
  Open vSwitch (git version) => DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck debian/rules binary, then install the module source package, cd to /usr/src/modules/openvswitch and execute 'debian/rules kdist_image' (https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/debian/openvswitch-datapath-source.README.Debian)
  Open vSwitch PKI
